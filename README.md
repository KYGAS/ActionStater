# ActionStater
States your actions in a fun way during the fights.

## Settings

Download the module and start the game.

Find your settings folder.

For toolbox : proxy/mods/ActionStater/config.json

For tera-proxy : proxy/settings/ActionStater.json

There you will see "instructions" on how to set up your module.

### Skills

Simply search for the name of the skill you want to add and it will take you to it.

Then you should test messages by yourself with casts/stages.

Since it would take too much time to filter out every specific skill how many casts/stages each one of them has.

After you have found the cast/stage of the skill you want, you are done.

If you find that some skills are broken( no combination of cast/stage works ), report it to the DMs of any of the authors since this module is a WIP and will rely on users to get completed..

For help feel free to DM any of the authors.
